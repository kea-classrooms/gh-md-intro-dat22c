I'm currently a 2nd semester CS student planning to graduate in January 2025 and hope to work as a Fullstack Software Developer. I like elegant, simple and useful software for the end-users and hope to work with tech transformations in established industries and cloud solutions - because heavy desktop apps and environments running on old servers is the past, and cloud is the future :rocket:
