**my dream in the not so distant future:**
I'm especially interested in working with essential software for state-owned eneterprises. Modelling a given section of state apparatus in order to deliver a digitalized solution is a great dream of mine, either working for the state itself or a private company such as KMD. In the process of this, I would like to pick up niche skills, and constantly develop these by taking educational courses.
